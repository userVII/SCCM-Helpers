## [Get-UninstallStrings](https://github.com/userVII/SCCM-Helpers/blob/main/Get-UninstallStrings.ps1)
Simple script to export a human readable list of uninstall strings from the registry to the current users downloads folder. When building SCCM apps, tracking these down can be a pain. Test your install, find the quiet uninstall string. Test, rinse, repeat.
